"""
iterm_pyapi — optional, best-effort placement helper using iTerm2's PYTHON API (not AppleScript).

Why this exists: packet 002 proved AppleScript's `move tab`/`set index of tab` are no-ops on this
machine — a spawned executor tab can land in the lead's WINDOW, but never truly ADJACENT to the
lead's own tab (always appended at the end of the tab bar instead). iTerm2's Python API has no such
limitation: `Window.async_create_tab(index=...)` genuinely inserts at the given index — confirmed
live (see the packet 007 report) by creating a tab at `lead_index + 1` and re-reading the window's
tab order back.

This module does PLACEMENT ONLY. Once a tab exists at the right index, `iterm.py`'s existing
AppleScript machinery (write text / /rename / pid capture / tab_color) targets that tab's session
by id exactly like it already does for the lead-window (non-adjacent) case — confirmed live that
Python API session ids and AppleScript's `id of session` are the SAME UUID space, so the handoff is
a simple string. This keeps the Python API's blast radius to "which index does the new tab land
at" and nothing else — no async_send_text, no API-side pid/rename handling to keep in sync with the
AppleScript path.

Zero new HARD dependency: the `iterm2` package is imported lazily, inside `try_create_adjacent_tab`
only, wrapped in `try/except`. If it's not installed, the API is disabled in iTerm's settings, no
window/tab/session actually contains the lead's session, or literally anything else goes wrong,
`try_create_adjacent_tab` returns None and the caller (`iterm.py`) falls back to its existing
AppleScript-only same-window placement — a spawn must never hang or fail over this being cosmetic.
