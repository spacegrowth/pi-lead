"""
iTerm2 backend for claude-relay: spawn a new tab running `claude` seeded with a prompt,
send a follow-up prompt into an existing live tab, and check aliveness.

Vendored/adapted from ~/.swiftbar/.lib/ccsessions/app.py (ITermBackend) — same title-matching
rules, scoped to just what relay needs. Tab title is owned by Claude Code's own OSC title updates
and mutable at any time, so send()/focus()/close()/is_alive() all address by the captured iTerm
session id (`iterm_session` / $TERM_SESSION_ID) first when one is available, falling back to the
bounded title match only for legacy/unowned sessions with no captured handle — see each function's
docstring. The caller (relay) additionally treats the recorded PID as the source of truth for
aliveness, the title/id match as a secondary confirmation.

    incident-spawn-misfire-2026-08-01.md): every binding here must be to the object CREATE RETURNED,
    never to a focus-dependent expression re-read after creation. The pre-fix code did
    `tell <window> to create tab …` and then, as a SEPARATE statement,
    `set targetSession to current session of <window>` — "current session" is whatever tab is
    SELECTED at the moment that statement runs, so a human cycling tabs between the two statements
    silently redirected `targetSession` at an existing tab, and the whole bootstrap payload
    (`… && exec claude --session-id …`) was typed into it. That is exactly what happened to the
    spawn of one real executor. `create tab with default profile` RETURNS the
    new tab, so binding through that return value is immune to focus moving.

    With `lead_handle` (the spawning lead's own iTerm session id), first try to find the window
    AND session matching it — same session-id walk as `_for_session_by_id` — then:
    - `layout="tab"` (default): create the new tab in the lead's window (`leadWindow`).
    - `layout="pane"`: split the lead's own SESSION (`leadSession`) vertically instead — the
      executor lands as a pane inside the lead's tab, not a separate tab. Confirmed live
      (osascript probe on this machine): `tell leadSession to set targetSession to (split
      vertically with default profile)` returns the new pane's session directly, and normal
      `write text`/`/rename` against it work exactly like a tab's session (a pane IS a session —
      title-matching, is_alive, send all keep working unchanged).
    `foundLeadWindow` is a plain boolean flag (not `try`/`on error`, since a no-match walk isn't
    an AppleScript error — it just completes without setting anything) so the fallback below
    still fires whenever the lead's session can't be located (unowned spawns, lead not in iTerm,
    lead's tab closed between arm and spawn, etc).

    NOTE (investigated live via osascript probes on this machine): iTerm2's AppleScript `move`
    command and `set index of tab` do NOT actually reposition tabs — `move tab to before/after
    otherTab` returns success but the tab order is unchanged, and `set index of tab to N` throws
    outright. So "adjacent to the lead's tab" as a separate TAB is NOT achievable here;
    same-window-at-end is the best available tab placement. `layout="pane"` sidesteps this
    entirely — a split pane has no "position in the tab bar" to fight over, it's just next to the
    lead's own pane by construction.

# (History — the inline guarded-bootstrap era, #24 Ask 3 then #25's wedge-proof reshape: the full
# bootstrap used to be TYPED, wrapped in a quote-free session-id conditional built from _GUARD_*
# segments joined around the runtime sid. It ended with §15b below: typing ~1KB of fragile text
# into a fresh tab proved unreliable regardless of shape — observed truncation mid-payload AND
# head-of-line corruption. The guard's properties survive in the file protocol: same runtime-sid
# comparison, same inert-on-mismatch, same exit-0, and the typed line is now too short and
# quote-free for any truncation to wedge. tests/test_backends.py keeps the old inline shape as a
# literal in its historical repro.)

# --- §15b (2026-08-02, field-blocking): the bootstrap is no longer TYPED at all -------------------
# Two live corruption modes killed the inline protocol, both on the CORRECT freshly-created tab:
#   - mid-payload truncation at a consistent ~1KB offset (inside the single-quoted Task prompt),
#     leaving an unterminated quote and a `quote>`-wedged tab (`cutoff-jump`, twice);
#   - head-of-payload corruption (`_relay_sid=` arrived as `sp_relay_sid=`), which made the guard
#     read an empty variable and no-op the launch in its own intended tab (rl-spawn resume).
# Both are symptoms of typing long fragile text into a shell that hasn't settled. The structural
# fix: write the COMPLETE bootstrap (guard, cd, colors, pidfile, exec claude with the full prompt,
# any length) to a per-session file, and type only one short, quote-free launch line:
#     sh <session dir>/bootstrap.sh <runtime session id>
# The receiving-tab guard moves INSIDE the file, comparing $ITERM_SESSION_ID against $1 — and $1 is
# spliced by AppleScript from `id of targetSession` at send time, so the guard's id and the typed-
# into session remain the same value by construction (#24's property, preserved). Truncate the
# typed line anywhere and the worst case is command-not-found or "sh: can't open" — nothing
# quote-open, nothing destructive; a truncated trailing $1 makes the guard mismatch and the file
# no-op with the notice. A sacrificial empty write precedes the launch line so head-eating consumes
# a blank line instead of the command. The file is also the exact durable record of what a launch
# ran — inspectable after any incident, unlike keystrokes.

    AppleScript call that resolves the target ONCE to a session id and then addresses every write by
    that id, so nothing that happens to focus or window order in between can redirect the payload.

    TARGET-OR-ABORT + INERT PAYLOAD (2026-08-01/02 spawn-misfire incident, write-up at
    ~/.relay-tasks/incident-spawn-misfire-2026-08-01.md — a lead's bootstrap, `exec claude
    --session-id …` and all, was typed into an unrelated live tab while the human cycled tabs).
    This took two rounds, and the first round's reasoning was incomplete:
      1. (#24) every target binding is to the object creation RETURNED (`_create_target_block`) —
         never re-read from the focus-dependent `current session of <window>`;
      2. (#25) but binding is not addressing. A specifier like `session N of tab M of window K` is
         POSITIONAL, so holding it across a reorder still wrote to the wrong session — proven by the
         `cutoff-jump` misfire, where the payload's guard carried the CORRECT id. Every write now
         re-resolves BY ID inside the matching loop iteration, the walk doubles as the existence
         re-check, and a miss returns a verdict WITHOUT typing. No focus-dependent expression
         reaches the send path at all;
      3. the frontmost tab's title at send time is captured and returned, so a caller reporting a
         failed launch can tell the human which tab to inspect;
      4. (§15b) the full bootstrap lives in a per-session FILE (write_bootstrap_file) and only a
         short quote-free `sh <file> <sid>` line is typed — the file's guard compares the receiving
         tab's own $ITERM_SESSION_ID against the runtime sid in $1, so a stray or truncated copy is
         a no-op even in a plain shell, and NO truncation point of the typed line can wedge anything.

    Returns a dict — `{"ok": bool, "reason": str, "session_id": str|None, "front_title": str|None,
    "placement": str}` — see `_read_spawn_outcome` and (pi-lead) `placement_line`. Never raises;
    `ok=False` means the launch did not happen, and `reason` distinguishes "nothing was typed" from
    "osascript failed, state indeterminate".

    Writes the launched process's PID to `pidfile` via `$$` + `exec` (the shell's PID becomes
    claude's PID after exec replaces the process image, so no race with backgrounding/job
    control, and the tab/pane stays fully interactive). PID capture and the tab-color printf are
    identical whether `targetSession` ends up being a tab's session or a split pane's session — a
    pane IS a session, so every downstream mechanism (pidfile, iterm_id_file, /rename, tab_color)
    is unchanged by `layout`.

    `tab_color` (r, g, b) paints the tab via a printf'd escape before exec — executors inherit
    their lead's color so related tabs group visually.

    `lead_handle` ($TERM_SESSION_ID of the spawning lead's own iTerm session, if known): when
    given, the new tab/pane is created in the LEAD'S window instead of whatever window happens to
    be current — best-effort, falls back to today's current-window behavior if the lead's session
    can't be located (unowned spawns, lead not in iTerm, any lookup miss). AppleScript alone can't
    place a new TAB truly adjacent to the lead's (see `_create_target_block`'s note — `move tab`/
    `set index of tab` are no-ops/errors on this machine), so for `layout="tab"` this first tries
    `iterm_pyapi.try_create_adjacent_tab` (iTerm2's Python API, which DOES support index-placed
    tab creation) and, only if that succeeds, hands the resulting session to the existing
    AppleScript write-text/rename machinery via `_target_by_session_id_block`. Any failure there
    (package not installed, API not enabled, timeout, anything) silently falls back to
    `_create_target_block`'s same-window-at-end placement — byte-identical to the pre-Python-API
    behavior, never blocking or failing the spawn over a cosmetic nicety.

    `layout` ("tab" default, or "pane"): with `layout="pane"` AND a resolvable `lead_handle`, the
    executor is opened as a split pane inside the LEAD'S OWN tab instead of a new tab — see
    `_create_target_block`. `layout="pane"` without a resolvable `lead_handle` degrades to the
    same tab-creation fallback as `layout="tab"` (never fails a spawn over layout preference).

    `type_name` (pi-lead): with False the script types no `/name <label>` after the launch line and has no
    rename delay — nothing is typed into the tab once pi may be running (pi-lead's extension names the tab);
    the script is otherwise byte-identical.

    `env_prefix` is a test-only hook (default "", no effect on real usage): a shell fragment
    prepended before the PID-capture step, e.g. `'PATH="/tmp/fakebin:$PATH" '` to scope a stub
    `claude` binary to just this one spawned command, without touching the real system PATH.
