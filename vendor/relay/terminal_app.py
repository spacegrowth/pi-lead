"""
Terminal.app backend for claude-relay — the same six operations as scripts/iterm.py (spawn, send,
is_alive, focus, close, rename_by_id) with one structural difference: **window-id addressing, not
title matching**. Terminal.app only exposes Claude Code's OSC title on the SELECTED tab, so titles
can't be trusted for liveness or lookup (proven in ccsessions' TerminalBackend, which this vendors
patterns from). Instead, spawn captures the new window's AppleScript `id` and every later operation
addresses `window id N` directly — stable for the window's lifetime, immune to title churn.

Differences from iTerm, by design of Terminal.app itself:
- Executors open as new WINDOWS, not tabs (Terminal has no scriptable tab-create without the
  Accessibility/TCC permission; ccsessions' menu-click workaround isn't worth the permission nag).
- No tab colors (`tab_color` is accepted and ignored — Terminal.app has no such facility).
- The handle written to `iterm_id_file` is "twid:<window id>"; a missing/foreign handle makes every
  operation return False rather than guess.

    IMMUNE to the 2026-08-01 iTerm spawn-misfire (target-or-abort; see iterm.spawn): there is no
    separate "type into the target" step to misdirect here. `do script "<cmd>"` with no `in <tab>`
    clause CREATES a window and runs the command in it atomically — the command can only execute in
    the window that call made, and nothing is ever typed into a pre-existing session. The window id
    is likewise derived from the returned tab's `tty`, never from `front window` (see below). So
