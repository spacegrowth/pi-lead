"""
report_verify — machine-check an executor's REPORT against its STAGED REALITY (backlog §6b, task
#7), with the §9 temper baked into every surface.

WHAT THIS IS NOT, stated first because it is the whole design constraint. Field data behind §9:
across ~15 real reports a counts-verifier would have caught exactly ONE thing (a lint miss). Every
*dangerous* problem was premise-level — wrong oracle, wrong write-side, suite green in the wrong
venv — and every one of those is invisible to re-running the declared commands. So this module is
deliberately built to be UNDER-trusted:

- the passing verdict is `COUNTS-MATCH`, never "PASS"/"VERIFIED"/"clean" — vocabulary that cannot
  be over-read at a glance;
- `CAVEAT` is emitted on every single output, not just failures;
- risk flags and UNVERIFIED lines are ECHOED verbatim, never summarised, never absorbed — the
  verifier's job is to put them in front of the lead, not to grade them;
- "did not run" is rendered differently from "ran and matched" (the §9.6a lesson): declared test
  commands are listed as NOT RE-RUN unless the caller explicitly asks for `--rerun`.

Everything here is pure — it takes the report text plus a `Reality` snapshot of git facts that
bin/relay gathers, and returns a result dict + rendered lines. That keeps the whole verdict surface
unit-testable without a git repo.

Where §6b leaves the mechanism open, this module prefers the CHEAP DETERMINISTIC check and says so
in its own output rather than guessing cleverly:
- claimed-changed files are read from the report's "What changed" section when it has one (scoped);
  with no such section the scan falls back to the whole report and the claimed-not-staged finding
  is DOWNGRADED to advisory, because a whole-report scan cannot tell "I changed x.py" from "I read
  x.py" and a false accusation is worse than a missed one here;
- `--rerun` only ever executes pytest commands, or exactly `npm test` / `npm run check` /
  `node --test`, with no shell metacharacters (see `rerunnable`): a report is untrusted text, and this tool must not become a way for one to run
  arbitrary shell in the lead's worktree.
  pi-lead tightens it further (`rerun_refusal`): argv[0] must BE pytest / python[3] -m pytest, no
  pytest option that writes/deletes/uploads outside the run (`--basetemp`, `--junitxml`, `-p`, …),
  no argument pointing outside the worktree — and a declared test command it refuses is NAMED
  under --rerun (`rerun-not-rerunnable`), never silently dropped.
  Besides pytest, pi-lead re-runs exactly three whole strings, `npm test`, `npm run check` and
  `node --test` (`RERUN_EXACT`; white space folded, nothing added, nothing in front), from an
  argument list written in lib/pilead/review.py — never the report's text. Their counts are read
  from pytest's summary line and node's test-runner lines (`runner_counts`), and compared per runner
  with what the report declares (`declared_for`); a declared count that no re-run of its runner
  produced is INCONCLUSIVE (`rerun-declared-not-compared`). Running one executes the worktree's own
  `package.json` scripts / test files: the same trust as a pytest re-run through `conftest.py`.

# INCONCLUSIVE exists because of the §9.6a lesson this module is built around: "did not run" must
# never look like "ran and matched". It fires ONLY when the caller explicitly asked for a check
# (`--rerun`) and that check produced no comparison — the declared command yielded no `N passed`,
# or there was nothing declared to compare against. Observed live on the first run of this tool:
# `python3 -m pytest` inside a subprocess resolved to an interpreter with no pytest installed, so
# the re-run "succeeded" with zero output — which under a three-verdict vocabulary would have
# stamped COUNTS-MATCH on a suite that never ran. That is the wrong-venv failure §9 names, and it
# would have come from this tool's own reporting. The DEFAULT (no --rerun) path is never
# INCONCLUSIVE: not asking for a re-run is a stated choice, rendered as "NOT RE-RUN".

# came from `_CLAIM_RE`-shaped matches that were never a claim at all:
#   1. a disclaimer   — "grepped tests/test_diff_render.py and deliberately did NOT change it"
#   2. a negated aside — "bin/relay untouched — confirmed empty diff"
#   3. a path template — "~/.relay-tasks/<sid>/session.json" quoted in prose, whose `<`/`>` let
#      `_CLAIM_RE` harvest the fragment `sid>/session.json` as a claimed file.
# Two independent filters below fix this WITHOUT touching `_CLAIM_RE` itself (over-matching there
# is still fine; it is what runs the match through these filters that must get stricter):
#   - `_claim_reject_reason` rejects the match on its own text, no context needed;
#   - `_negated_context` rejects it based on the CLAUSE it sits in (see `_clause_span`).
# A genuine claim elsewhere in the report is unaffected — `plausible_claims`'s repo-existence
# check (below) is a separate, already-existing filter and stays exactly as it was.
#
# Reviewer should-fix on the row-76 fix (gate-171051 review): `_negated_context` used to scope a
# cue to the whole LINE/BULLET, which forgave every path on it — "did not change a.py, but
# modified b.py" wrongly forgave `b.py` too, and a wrapped bullet's continuation clause could
# forgive a path named on an earlier, unrelated clause. `_clause_span` narrows the window one step
# further, to the CLAUSE containing the match: split on `,` `;`, the connectives `but` / `then` /
# `and then` / `while`, and a physical line break (a wrapped bullet's continuation reads as its own
# clause, never sharing a cue with the line before it). A path is a non-claim only when a cue sits
# in ITS clause.
#
# The reviewer's suggested split set also named the em/en dash (`—`/`–`); this deliberately drops
# them. Nearly every "What changed" bullet in this codebase (and this file's own fixtures) is
# written `path — verb-based description` ("src/app.py:2 — appended the new line."). `_clause_span`
# is shared with `_has_claiming_verb` (rule 2 below), whose whole job is finding a claiming verb in
# the SAME clause as the path it might add — splitting on the dash would put that path in one
# clause and its own describing verb in the next, breaking the single most common way a real claim
# is written. None of the three reproduction cases below need the dash to pass.

# The gate that lets an autonomous lead commit an executor's work WITHOUT asking. Five conditions,
# ALL required. This module can only ever check three of them; the other two are the lead's, and
# the design point is that it must say so rather than quietly scoring 3/5 as a pass.
#
# §9 is binding here more than anywhere else in this file: **the verifier gates the AUTOMATION, it
# never replaces the lead reading the diff.** A COUNTS-MATCH is the ceiling of what the machine
# knows (see CAVEAT) — it is a necessary condition for auto-commit, never a sufficient one. That is
# exactly why conditions 3 and 5 exist and why they are attestations rather than inferences: if
# this tool guessed at them, it would be manufacturing the very "the report looked clean" judgement
# that #16 phase 2 was blocked on until #7 existed.
